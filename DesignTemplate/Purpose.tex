\label{chap:purpose}

The SMP and Mecanum robots are intended for demonstration and research purposes. They are intended to provide a "minimal working set" or ROS packages that can be used for testing or expanded to fulfill other roles. These robots are not intended for use in robotics competitions, but they could be adapted for competition fairly easily. The 2 SMP robots are functional both in and outdoors, while Mecanum is only really feasible for indoor use.
