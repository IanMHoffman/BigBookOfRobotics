\chapter{ROS Architecture}
\label{chap:rosarch}

In this chapter, list the nodes running and show an rqtplot or similar visualization. Provide reasons behind the choices made for the design, if algorithms were a strong point of the design.

\section{Nodes}

\begin{itemize}
\item{Node 1}
\item{Node 2}
\item{...}
\end{itemize}


Describe the node functions here in as many subsections as you have nodes.
