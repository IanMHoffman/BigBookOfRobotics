\chapter{Mechanical Design}
\label{chap:mechdesign}

This chapter details the mechanical design, as well as the reason behind some of the decisions that were made regarding the mechanical design. Provide pictures and talk about the general design concepts, such as kinematics and overall structure. If you did your own design, talk about the choices you made the motivation behind them. If you did something unique with the mechanical design, such as an unusual type of steering or suspension, make sure to discuss it in detail here.

If you did your own design, include solidworks models, schematics, or CAD drawings. It may also be useful to include the processes required to fabricate the robot.
