XU3 setup

1. Install Fuser
	(Note: you can use
		cat /etc/issue
	to check your Fedora version)
	
	If running Fedora 21+
	sudo yum install smd-odroid-release
	sudo yum install odroid-xu3-sd-fuser

	If running fedora 20
	sudo yum install http://csc.mcs.sdsmt.edu/smd-odroid/fedora/linux/21/x86_64/odroid-xu3-sd-fuser-0.2.0-1.fc21.noarch.rpm

	Plug in emmc via microsd to sd converter.

	Check the github wiki for more instructios on the fuser:
	https://github.com/sdsmt-robotics-odroids/odroid-xu/wiki/Boot-Media-Fusing

	sudo odroid-xu3-emmc-fuser /dev/mmcblkX

	Find the value of X by : 
	ls /dev/mmcblk*

	should see this:
	Successfully enabled write access to /dev/mmcblk0boot0.
	Fusing boot blob to /dev/mmcblk0boot0...
	1262+0 records in
	1262+0 records out
	646144 bytes (646 kB) copied, 1.71663 s, 376 kB/s
	Success!
	
2. Load the emmc image 
	get the image from: http://csc.mcs.sdsmt.edu/smd-odroid/fedora/linux/21/Images/armhfp/
	
	Make sure you get the newest one for the odroid type you have, in the .xz format

	run this to uncompress
	xz -d <foo>.img.xz

	This will take some time, about a minute.

	MAke sure you unmount the partitions from the filesystem before running the dd command. Be careful
	sudo umount /dev/mmcblk0p*

	Be careful with this or you'll explode your computer
	sudo dd if=<foo>.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=8M

	This will take a little time. 3-4 minutes

	Should see something like this:
	204+1 records in
	204+1 records out
	1713373184 bytes (1.7 GB) copied, 91.7598 s, 18.7 MB/s

	Run sync. Maybe twice. Just do it.

3. Go
	Only  root user is enable by default
	password is super_secure

4. Instal ROS - won't be necessary once Scott gets the kickstart version with ROS up and running

Common Error:

 One of the configured repositories failed (Fedora 21 - armhfp),
 and yum doesn't have enough cached data to continue. At this point the only
 safe thing yum can do is fail. There are a few ways to work "fix" this:

     1. Contact the upstream for the repository and get them to fix the problem.

     2. Reconfigure the baseurl/etc. for the repository, to point to a working
        upstream. This is most often useful if you are using a newer
        distribution release than is supported by the repository (and the
        packages for the previous distribution release still work).

     3. Disable the repository, so yum won't use it by default. Yum will then
        just ignore the repository until you permanently enable it again or use
        --enablerepo for temporary usage:

            yum-config-manager --disable fedora

     4. Configure the failing repository to be skipped, if it is unavailable.
        Note that yum will try to contact the repo. when it runs most commands,
        so will have to try and fail each time (and thus. yum will be be much
        slower). If it is a very temporary problem though, this is often a nice
        compromise:

            yum-config-manager --save --setopt=fedora.skip_if_unavailable=true

Cannot retrieve metalink for repository: fedora/21/armhfp. Please verify its path and try again

Root cause - internal cause is wrong and the certificates are not valid. Synch the clock to fix this error
	type date to check time
	update system clock
	ntpdate ntp.sdsmt.edu
	(only for this run - temporary fix)

	update the hardware clock to the current system clock
	hwclock -w

	If you don't have an RTC battery, this will need to be done every time you boot or yum won't work

If weird things the dtb file not being updated with the kernel happen, just get a new image and repeat. This will be
fixed in a future image.


NExt Install Ros
	Install the repo where our install of ROS lives
	sudo yum install http://csc.mcs.sdsmt.edu/smd-pub/fedora/linux/21/armhfp/smd-ros-release-21-2.noarch.rpm

	You also need rpm fusion - extended set of packages not in the basic fedora rpms
	sudo yum localinstall --nogpgcheck http://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm  -E %fedora).noarch.rpm http://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm	

	Now you can sudo yum install pretty much any ros fedora package
	this is a good starting point, particularly if you're not using PCL or Gazebo
	sudo yum install ros-indigo-robot

	Another useful set of packages if you're compiling on the device
	Some of these aren't REALLY required, but you proabably want them
	sudo yum install python-rosdep python-rosinstall_generator python-wstool python-rosinstall @buildsys-build

	A link to the ROS wiki with more information
	WIKI:
	http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Source

	This is a pretty basic install. You'll want to run
	rosdep install --from-path <src> --ignore-src
	where src is a path to a directory containing ros packages. This will install any missing dependancies that
	may not have been installed this far.
