Go for buying 6 motor controllers
Go for buying 8 11.1v lipos
Look at routers
Need 4 more motors with encoders

Get 4 displays from ameridroid

Add fuses
All robots need switches

Need 3 dc to dc converters

superdroid 24v motors on the 6whweel

buy 4 - XU3 Lite
EMMCs
Clock batteries

Document system setup

Phase 2 - Ros infrastructure with Matt's? control panel

Phase 3 - sensors

Installing linux and ros on the odroid

Context

Rich and Scott talking about where to go once rpm in ROS Jade.
Jade coming soon
How do make Fedora better
Utilize Kickstart
live CDs - push button go
VM images - download go
images for common platforms such as fedora ros on odroid
eventually jenkins will build images for ros and odroids with updated stuff
  dumps out .img to set up sd cards
Angelmaker

There exists a livecd for fedora 21 64 bit, arm coming soon

How scott used to do this:
  start with nothing
  dump packages at filesystem
  rpm or deb install
  bootstrap the system, usually a livecd with rpm, yum, anaconda
  installs to new empty harddrive
  post install tasks - keyboard, language, initramfs for kernel, timezone, user passwords
  
  empty sd card file partitioned
    special folders
     /dev
     /dev/shm
     /dev/pts
     /sys
     /proc
     /tmp
    
  binding mount
    binds folders on runnign system to those folders
  mount -o bind /dev /mnt/tmp/dev
  
  in /mnt/tmp
  mkdir proc sys dev tmp dev/pts dev/shm
  
  bind to real system directory
  mount -o bind /proc ./proc
  mount -o bind /tmp tmp
  mount -o bind /dev dev
  mount -o bind /dev/pts dev/pts
  mount -o bind /dev/shm dev/shm
  
  yum --install-root=/mnt/tmp --releasever=21 install filesystem --nogpgcheck(Note: need to use arm to build arm
  y
  
  yum --install-root=/mnt/tmp --releasever=21 groupinstall "Minimal Install" --nogpgcheck
  y
  
  vim etc/shadow (must do as root)
   - remove the star from root
   - then log in and set the root password save with w!
  
  
  (on the host filesystem)
  unmount dev/pts
  unmount dev/shm
  unmount dev
  unmount proc
  unmount tmp
  unmount 
  
  
  Actual way to do it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  Kickstart, look it  under anaconda wiki
  http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda/Kickstart
    started based on tablet kickstart
    
    don't set nontp
  
  how to use livemedia creator in the context of arm
  
  partitioning info in .ks file
    after firewall --disabled
    
  #root password
  rootpw --plaintext super_secure
    
  #partition the disk
  bootloader --location=none
  zerombr
  clearpart --all
  part /boot/uboot -size 100 --fstype vfat
  part / --size 1536 --fstype ext4
  part swap --size 500
  
  
  sudo copy livemedia creator command form website point at kickstarter file, need to be root  
  yields an img, write to sdcard or emmc using dd
  
  still needs kernel and bootloader
    from hardkernel for odroid
    
  dracut for init ramfs
  
  Way the odroids boot
  
  bl2, sets execution address to 2nd byte on sd card and starts executing, firmware needs to be at front of card
  after all the raw data, uboot itself. Has capability of accessing first vfat partition on system
  uboot finds boot.ini - contains uboot commands that are paths to where kernel is, kernel args, specifically specify where root partition is
  use uuid to specify root location partition
  
  On EMMCs
  
  remember raw data at front os SD card - written to a special partition on the EMMC especially for bootloader and data
    should have 2 extra partitions on our EMMCs
      ls /dev/mmcblk*
